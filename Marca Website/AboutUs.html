						In order to enhance the condition, specifically utilization and access the Ministry of 
						Health and Family Welfare have built over 14,000 community clinics through the programme 
						‘Revitalisation of Community Health Care Initiative in Bangladesh (RCHCIB)—Community Clinic Project’ 
						mainly to provide essential care package for women and children. But, these facilities are yet to gain 
						full-scale level of utilization due to several factors. <br><br>

						Therefore, it is paramount to examine health outcomes using social and economic factors. Utilization of 
						healthcare services is crucial and interventions that improve the use will also improve the general health 
						outcomes. Nevertheless, rural women should have adequate awareness about community health services.			    	
				          <p>
						The major products of the project To describe our services are:
                         Affordability, morality, diversity, customs e.t.c.
