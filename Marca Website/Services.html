	        	Clinical research should be seen as the social good that it is. The first step in tackling this challenge is regularly getting the public to think about participating in clinical research. People need to consider how they can help advance the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. It is never too early to consider participation whether or not someone ultimately chooses to join a study.

	        	 Groundbreaking scientific advances in the present and the past were possible only because of the participation of clinical research volunteers, both healthy and ill. Clinical research requires complex and rigorous testing in collaboration with communities that are affected by the disease. As NIH-supported clinical research opens new doors to advancing prevention, treatments, and cures for disease and disability, clinical trial volunteer participants are essential to this progress.
